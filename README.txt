Please note that to register a Service Worker script
your site should have a valid SSL certificate or its domain should be "localhost".

In order to register your service worker script go to
Home -> Administration -> Configuration -> Service Worker Registration Settings and
enter a relative path to your service-worker.js (from the site root), e.g. sites/default/service-worker.js.
